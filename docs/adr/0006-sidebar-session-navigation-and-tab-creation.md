# Sidebar Session Navigation and Tab Creation

Opening an unopened Session or creating a Session from the Sidebar now opens as the first Pane in a new Tab (inserted immediately to the right of the active Tab) or reuses an active empty Welcome Tab, instead of splitting the currently focused Tab. Activating an already-opened Session focuses that existing View and switches to its Tab.

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Previously, clicking a Session row in the Sidebar, opening a session via context menu, or creating a new Agent/Terminal session called `openTarget`, which split the currently focused Tab by placing a new Pane to its right. This disrupted the user's active Tab layout and caused existing Panes to squish and reflow whenever a new Session was visited. Furthermore, clicking an already-opened Session from another Tab created redundant splits or was difficult to locate across Tabs.

## Decision

We update the Workbench target opening policy (`applyOpenTarget`):

1. **Reuse Existing Views**: If the target Session or draft already exists in the active Tab, focus its Pane directly. If it exists in another Tab, activate the leftmost Tab containing it and focus its Pane.
2. **Reuse Welcome Tab**: If the target Session is not open in any Tab, and the active Tab is an empty Welcome Tab (`welcome` View), replace the Welcome View in-place with the target Session.
3. **Open in New Tab**: If the target Session is not open in any Tab and the active Tab contains existing work, insert a new Tab immediately to the right of the active Tab containing the target Session as its sole first Pane, and immediately activate that Tab.
4. **Explicit Splitting**: In-tab splitting remains accessible via explicit gestures: `Alt + Click` (or `Alt + Shift + Click`) on a Session row, and dragging a Session onto an existing Pane's drop zones.

## Consequences

- The active Tab's layout is protected from unintended mutation and reflow during casual navigation.
- Deep links, router navigation, and sidebar clicks share unified, deterministic behavior across the Workbench.
- Users maintain full control over multi-pane workflows via keyboard modifiers and drag-and-drop.
