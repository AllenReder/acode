/**
 * Platform facts shared by the appearance layer and the terminal renderer.
 *
 * The native desktop bridge is authoritative when it reports a known platform.
 * Tauri's bridge returns the sentinel `"other"` until its runtime config
 * resolves — and permanently when that config fails — so an unknown value must
 * fall through to the browser signals instead of being treated as "not
 * Windows". Browser `navigator` signals only classify the OS; they never imply
 * a native glass stage.
